With the Storm
===

A simple utility program to use with the game [Against the Storm](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1336490/Against_the_Storm/).  It reads your save file and shows you the current blueprint choice, but annotates it to show which recipes can be satisfied now/in-the-future/never (within the current level).

**Note that it reads the save file.  Against the Storm unfortunately (for our purposes) does not auto-save that often.  If the blueprint choice appears out-of-date, cancel the choice in the game, go to the menu and "Save and Quit" and then click Play to go straight back into the game.  This will force a save, and the window will automatically update.**

If you notice any bugs, file an issue here.  The "Save.save" file from the "%userprofile%\appdata\locallow\Eremite Games\Against the Storm" directory will help immensely.
